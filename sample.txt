I have configured your React application for deployment to GitHub Pages and set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment.

Here's a summary of the changes:
1.  Installed the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency.
2.  Modified [`package.json`](package.json) to include `homepage`, `predeploy`, and `deploy` scripts.
3.  Updated [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts) to set the `base` path for GitHub Pages.
4.  Created a new GitHub Actions workflow file at [`./.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to automate the build and deployment process on pushes to the `main` branch.

To see your application live, you will need to push these changes to your `tsubasakawai3.github.io` repository's `main` branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will then automatically build and deploy your application.
